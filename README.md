The objective of the project is to determine/predict the annual salary of NBA players based on their performance statistics.

# Approach

1. Data collection from various source
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Multicollinearity testing
4. Feature Engineering
5. Model Building
6. Using K-fold Cross Validation to fine tune the model

#Result

We were able to determine the variance of the target variable upto 65% and using Neural Network with 1 hidden layer, 3 neurons and tanh
as the activation function, we were able to predict upto 75%.
